# Data Bazar App

In today's digital world, data is generated everywhere. Personal data is particularly sensitive and often becomes the focus of discussions, especially since the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. Long-term data, when analyzed, can provide valuable insights for scientific research and even have monetary value. In the healthcare sector, for instance, such data can contribute to improving diagnostics or advancing treatment options.
